This readme is just a guide to the content here. I've put this on the backburner for a little while, but this is my code for working along with the [PortSwigger Web Security Learning Path](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path). 
Except instead of using PortSwigger I use python and requests. 

Implimented so far:

1. [SQL Injection](https://bitbucket.org/4NT1R34L15T/hacking/src/master/notebooks/PortSwigger/SQLInjection/) which are attacks that attempt to put SQL code in web requests to extract data from the website.
2. [Authentication](https://bitbucket.org/4NT1R34L15T/hacking/src/master/notebooks/PortSwigger/Authentication/) which involve attacks on login processes for extracting information and gaining access.
3. [OS Command Injection](https://bitbucket.org/4NT1R34L15T/hacking/src/master/notebooks/PortSwigger/OS%20Command%20Injection/) (IN PROGRESS) which is similar to SQL injections but attempt to actually run shell commands.

The notebooks have links to the PortSwigger learning labs and contain some exposition in the markdown cells.
